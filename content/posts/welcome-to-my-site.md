Here's my take on *gif* or *jif*..

I believe it should be pronounced as *jif*. Not only because of the [hard and soft G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_G) rule. But also, simply because GIF is an abbreviation. Which means every letter is to be announced by its name; G = *jee*, I = *aai*, and F = *eff*. together it should be *jiff*. As opposed to, for example, Git. Which is a noun. Hence pronounced *git*.

That is the gist of it I think.
